# Furry Friends Gallery Mk. II

This is a new and enhanced version of the Furry Friends Gallery Mk. I project, which I recently made. This web app allows the end users to select and view the good doggos based on their breed(s)! 😊

This is a dog pictures gallery, but this time, using the Dogs as a Service API.

Moved to a slightly different API provider for a few reasons:
1. It handles paging via the API;
2. It deals with API keys and sending them via request handles;
3. It offers more flexibility in the data that we receive.
